   <p> 
        My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a segwat, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:

        <ul>
            <li> Cell Phone</li>
            <li>ipod</li>
            <li> digital camera</li>
            <li> and a protein bar</li>
        </ul>

        Just the essentials. as Lao Tzu wouldhave said, <q> A journey of a thousand miles begins with one segway.</q>
