Here’s Tony’s journal. Go ahead and rework his Lao Tzu quote to use the <q> element. After you’ve done it on paper, make the changes in your “journal.html” file and give it a test drive. You’ll find the solution in the back of the chapter.

<h1>Segway'n USA</h1>
<p> Documenting my trip around the US on my very own Segway! </p>
<h2>August 20, 2012</h2>

<pW>ell I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed
through some interesting places on the way: Walla Walla, WA, Magic City, ID, Bountiful, UT, Last Chance, CO, Why, AZ and Truth or Consequences, NM.
</p>
<pI> saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the
road today: "Passing cars, When you can't see, May get you, A glimpse, Of eternity." I definitely won't be passing any cars.
</p>
<pM>y first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway,
I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me: cell phone, iPod, digital camera, and a protein bar. Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said, "A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway."
