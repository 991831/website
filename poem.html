    <h1>Behind The Mask</h1>
    
    <p>I see a drop of sweat fall on the stage<br>
    I am exhausted<br>
    I bow once more to my fans and leave for the night<br>
    I go live later that night<br>
    I see some people saying horrible things to me<br>
    I am exhausted<br>
    I say goodbye to my fans, I'm out cold</p>
    
    <p>It's morning, I have another concert to attend<br>
    I eat very little because my manager says I'm gaining weight<br>
    I am exhausted<br>
    I put on my happy face and preform<br>
    I go home, wash up, go live again and see the words<br>
    "Kill yourself" I turn off my phone</p>
    
    <p>Manager tells me to go excercise, I do<br>
    I am exhausted<br>
    I sleep and do it all over again<br>
    I want to be free and be me<br>
    I want to be me.</p>
